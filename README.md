# Sketches

This repository contains the Processing sketches I am making.

All the folders are sketches. Some folders contains are special:

- `libraries`: contains the external libraries used by the sketches (most notably the video export lib)

## How to use

In order to use the sketches, you need processing 3. You can download the IDE [here](https://processing.org/).
