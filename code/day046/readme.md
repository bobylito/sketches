## Notes about this animation

- seeing pattern emerging from particles is super cool and quite organic
- I want to explore on this side

## Technical notes

- It's a new field of exploration
- pretty fast even with a non trivial number of particles
- there are particles generated
- the particles speed is influenced by a field generated by a perlin noise
- the field is scaled out
