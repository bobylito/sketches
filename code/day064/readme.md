title: Day 64 [/] double vision

## General notes (inspiration, ideas, concept)

- improving on last sketch
- camera movement to have the whole scene inside the screen
- glitches inspired me
- added some background to fill the space

## Technical notes

- have the camera follow the center of the worm
- scale is based on max(width, height) of the worm
