Notes about the animation

- uses masks to create the stencil
- first animation with fonts
- PGraphics are used to prerender the circle and the NEON stencil
- the cutout is simply applying the stencil on the scene
- the glow is done by drawing the circles twice: circles, blur, circles
- tried the blur shader from the examples. Super fast but the effect was not strong enough. I will dig
