## General notes (inspiration, ideas, concept)

- a complex animation
- simple colors
- inspired from a post I saw on instagram and the multiple motion design things

## Technical notes

- This is a most complex scened animation done so far
- The step and currentStepFrame make it easy to build the animations
- I like the pattern of creating a variable and then modifying it in a step
