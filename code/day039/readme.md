## Notes about this animation

This animation is made of meta balls. I started with an array as I thought it would be
easier. I'm not sure I even need the array at all actually :/ That's not an exercise in
perf, and yet that's good to think about it.

I like the nice pixelated effect and the colors.

## Technical difficulties

- beyond size 100, you can feel the lag
