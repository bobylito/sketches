title: Day 69 %% clock is ticking
---

## General notes (inspiration, ideas, concept)

- I started by doing something automatic and simple
- then I refined the idea: adding colors, a background and the stroke
- I didn't manage to rotate the background correctly and kept it while tweaking the angle
- the stroke on circles was not expected, I kept it too

## Technical notes

- nothing really :D
