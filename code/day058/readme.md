title: Day 58 -_ prison escape
---

## General notes (inspiration, ideas, concept)

- directly inspired from breakout / arkanoid
- second part of the futile actions serie (first is the mindless eating of day 57)
- colors are taken from the original game screenshots I could find

## Technical notes

- implemented a naive collision and rebound system
- did a for loop to avoid more complex math
